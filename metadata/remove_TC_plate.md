# Removing the thermocycler slot guard
In order to set the OT-2's deck up properly to run POLAR, the thermocycler will need to be modified very slightly. 
<br>

You'll need to flip the thermocycler over to access a small black rectangular plate thats secured with 2X T10 Torx screws. 
<br>

We're interested in freeing up the slot marked by the red line. Removing this piece allows us to place the thermocycler offset to the left side, only occupying deck slots 7 and 10, and freeing up slots 8 and 11 for additional tip boxes. Unscrew these two screws and remove the plate. Toss these items into a drawer if you're like most of us, or store them properly for reinstallation later  
<br>

**NOTE:** Placing the thermocycler in this offset position will remove the ability for the robot to reach column 1 of the thermocycler plate with the right mount. However, the left mount will still be able to access this position. The POLAR protocol doesn't ever use the right mount to access this column so it's not an issue. Remember to move the thermocycler back to the original position when changing to another protocol that assumes the thermocycler in its normal position.
